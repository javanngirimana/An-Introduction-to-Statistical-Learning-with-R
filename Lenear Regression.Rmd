## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Statistical Learning
#2.3.1 Basic Commands
# R uses functions to perform operations
# In the following formulas, you can use (= or <-) signs

x <- c(1, 3, 2, 5)
x
```
```{r}
x= c(1, 6, 2)
x
y= c(1, 4, 3)
y
```


# length
```{r}
x= c(1, 6, 2)
y= c(1, 4, 3)
length(x)
length(y)
x+y
```

# We use (ls) to display all functions used before
# we use (rm) to delete unwanted functions
```{r}
ls()

rm()
```

# It’s also possible to remove all objects at once:
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```



```{r}
ls()
```

# Matrix
# Option 1 of designing matrix
```{r}
x <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
x
```
# Option 2 of designing matrix
```{r}
x <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 2, 2)
x
```


# Option 3 of designing matrix (byrow = TRUE)
```{r}
matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 2, 2, byrow = TRUE)
```

# The sqrt() function returns the square root of each sqrt() element of a vector or matrix.
```{r}
sqrt(x)
```

# The command x^2 raises each element of x to the power 2
```{r}
x^2
```


# The rnorm() function generates a vector of random normal variables, rnorm() with first argument n the sample size. 

```{r}
x <- rnorm(50)
y <- x + rnorm(50, mean = 50, sd = .1)
cor(x, y)
```


# we can use the (set.seed()) to reproduce the exact same set of random numbers
```{r}
set.seed(1303)
rnorm(50)
```


# The mean() and var() functions can be used to compute the mean and mean() var() variance of a vector of numbers.

```{r}
set.seed(3)
y <- rnorm(100)
mean(y)
var(y)
sqrt(var(y))
sd(y)
```

# Graphics
# Statistical Learning

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
plot(x, y)
plot(x, y, xlab = "this is the x-axis",
ylab = "this is the y-axis",
main = "Plot of X vs Y")
```


# to create a pdf, we use the pdf() function, and to create a jpeg, pdf() we use the jpeg() function.

```{r}
pdf("Figure.pdf")
plot(x, y, col = "green")
dev.off()
```

# integer arguments.

```{r}
x <- seq(1, 10)
x
x <- 1:10
x
x <- seq(-pi, pi, length = 50)
```
# output of the contour() function
```{r}
y <- x
f <- outer(x, y, function(x, y) cos(y) / (1 + x^2))
contour(x, y, f)
contour(x, y, f, nlevels = 45, add = T)
fa <- (f - t(f)) / 2
contour(x, y, fa, nlevels = 15)
```


# Persp() can be used to produce a three-dimensional persp() plot

```{r}
image(x, y, fa)
persp(x, y, fa)
persp(x, y, fa, theta = 30)
persp(x, y, fa, theta = 30, phi = 20)
persp(x, y, fa, theta = 30, phi = 70)
persp(x, y, fa, theta = 30, phi = 40)
```


# 2.3.3 Indexing Data
# Suppose that our data is stored in the matrix A.

```{r}
A <- matrix(1:16, 4, 4)
A
```

#Then, typing
```{r}
A[2, 3]
```


# We can also select multiple rows and columns at a time, by providing vectors as the indices

```{r}
A[c(1, 3), c(2, 4)]
A[1:3, 2:4]
A[1:2, ]
```



# 2. Statistical Learning

```{r}
A[, 1:2]
```


# R treats a single row or column of a matrix as a vector.
```{r}
 A[1, ]
```


# The use of a negative sign
```{r}
A[-c(1, 3), ]
A[-c(1, 3), -c(1, 3, 4)]
```



# The dim() function outputs the number of rows followed by the number of columns of a given matrix.
```{r}
dim(A)
```

# 2.3.4 Loading Data

# Once the data has been loaded, the View() function can be used to view it in a spreadsheet-like window.
# The head() function can also be used to view the first few rows of the data.

```{r}
Auto <- read.table("Auto.data")
View(Auto)
head(Auto)
```


```{r}
Auto <- read.table("Auto.data", header = T, na.strings = "?",
stringsAsFactors = T)
View(Auto)
```
